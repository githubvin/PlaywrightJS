/**
 * 
 * Assignment Details:
Create a JavaScript program that defines a function to compute the intersection of two arrays. The intersection should include elements that appear in both arrays without any duplicates.
Assignment Requirements:
1. Write a function named `intersection` that accepts two arguments, `arr1` and `arr2`, which are arrays of numbers, and returns an array of their intersection.
2. Ensure no duplicate elements in the resulting array. If an element appears in both `arr1` and `arr2`, it should appear only once in the result.
3. Use a loop to find common elements. Iterate through each element of `arr1` and check if it is present in `arr2` and not already included in the result array.
4. Include example calls to the `intersection` function with different arrays to demonstrate the functionâ€™s functionality. Include examples with no common elements, all elements common, and typical cases.
Expected Outcome:
Upon completion, you should be able to:
- Understand the concept of arrays and loops in JavaScript.
- Demonstrate the calculation of intersection for various array inputs, handling both typical and edge cases.

//     // Looping through each element in arr1 
//     for (let i=0; i < arr1.length-1; i++){
//         if (set2.has(arr1[i]) && !resourceLimits.includes([i])) {
//             mixedArr.push([i]); 
//         }
